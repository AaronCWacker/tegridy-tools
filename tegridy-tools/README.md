#### 2) noteseq
##### This is a modified and streamlined version of the original noteseq package that is stand-alone and independent of anything, including Tensorflow and the need to install any unique/fancy prerequisites.


### Description of modules:

#### 1) TMIDI Module
##### This module is all about MIDI and Artifical Intellgence/Algorithmic Intelligence. All functions there specifically tailored to help to create/design Music AI systems and/or Algo Music systems.

##### As an example for what and where TMIDI can be useful, see this link: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/notebooks#community-notebooks

##### Fun and exciting things you might want to try:

##### 1) Try TMIDI with the Summarization implementations. Can this be used to make bridges between musical pieces?

##### 2) Try TMIDI with QA implementations. Does music have QA elements? 

##### 3) Try TMIDI with Translator implementations. How music can be translated and permutated?!?

##### 4) Try TMIDI with Sentiment Analysis...etc.

##### Enjoy and have fun :)
